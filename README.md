# Computer Graphics: Mathematical Carousel

This was the third project developed for the Computer Graphics course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in the school year 2023/2024. It was made using the Three.js JavaScript library. It models a scene with a three revolving rings, each one with parametric geometries on top, in which we resorted to elements such as textures, lighting and materials. We also implemented support for VR devices.
